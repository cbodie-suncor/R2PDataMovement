- fixed Graham's bug with Montreal Sulphur
- added a TransactionEvent to log events for use by a dashboard
- re-did Denver to scrape xls  (file drop in GP01 or GP02)
- refactored unit tests to be runnable from GitHub
- only look to 1st line of currentDate.txt (other lines can be used to include a description)
- TerraNova done
- DPS almost done : promoted
- ignoring 0 quantity records for Montreal Sulphur

Outstanding
- use units in the DPS file
- make currentDate.txt and tagMappings.csv plant specific
- provide a sample XLS dashboard (hooked up to the R2P Intergration DB)
- add tagmappings errors to the dashboard
- moving the currentDate.txt to currentDate.processed.txt after 1 load (need to put this in the file as a explanation)
- research user name stamp for files (might be possibly when the public azure storage is setup with a fileshare ie: \\pbidevarmsta001.file.core.windows.net\sap-iot-data)
